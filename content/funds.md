# Financial Strategy with Bitcoin

At Cypher, we've embraced Bitcoin as a core component of our financial operations, aligning with our innovative and transparent business model. Bitcoin serves not only as our primary funding and payment method but also plays a vital role in building community incentives. This part is still experimental and in early development.
<br><br>
Why Bitcoin?  Its decentralized nature allows for efficient and global transactions, making it ideal for our diverse and widespread community. The transparency and security of Bitcoin transactions align with our values of trust and openness.
<br><br>

Cold Storage as a Savings Account: We leverage cold storage to securely hold a portion of our funds offline. This approach functions like a digital savings account, providing enhanced security and stability for our long-term financial reserves.
<br><br>

Using the Lightning Network for Operational Efficiency: For day-to-day transactions, including development purchases, hosting, and domain expenses, we utilize the Lightning Network. This second-layer solution on the Bitcoin blockchain enables us to conduct fast, low-cost transactions, maintaining operational efficiency and financial agility.

## Open Finance and Accounting

A cornerstone of our financial strategy is transparency. All incoming and outgoing funds are visible, creating an open finance system. This level of transparency ensures accountability and builds trust within our community and stakeholders.

By integrating Bitcoin into our financial practices, we're not just adopting a cryptocurrency; we're embracing a philosophy of innovation, security, and transparency that resonates with our company's ethos and the future of finance.
